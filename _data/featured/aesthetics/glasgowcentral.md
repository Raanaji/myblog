## Introduction

Despite the wave of monstrosity of modern architecture unleashed by the sacrilege of all nation states, i.e. the fifth republic, the stunning Victorian architecture still stands upright, gazing with its stunning design and architectural ingenuity.

My intent here is not to discuss and drool over the historical nuances relating to the engineering challenges faced, nor the competition between different private consortiums jumping into the railway business during the Victorian era. No! 

However, before we discuss the various facets covering the different grades of architectural shades covering the buildings standing by the pavements of Glasgow city centre, especially the Glasgow Central Station, it is imperative we lay down a little background and some patchwork regarding the psychological base of our thoughts. 

## Intent

I intend to discuss the subtle psychological intricacies relating to the Victorian era buildings in downtown Glasgow (particularly the entirety of Buchanan Street including Glasgow Queen Street as well). From my own experiences relating to these areas, especially evening [flaneuring](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Flaneuring-Wander-Intention-Discover/dp/1982133511) around Buchanan street during early January of the year, **one can feel a very heavy profoundness while walking down those alleys while the kitchen backdoors of restaurants are releasing the steamy warm air blurring the light from those bright alley lamps, right opposite to a building with back steel stairways**. Galina Walls does a brilliant job in describing this

Photo by Galina Walls: It’s amazing how industrial the backs of Victorian and Edwardian houses look

Walls has summarized the amalgamated Glaswegian alleys  in beautiful terms 

> The austerity of the industrial lines and textures of Glasgow back walls almost exposes the **neo-Classical pretence of its Victorian and Edwardian façades**. The clusters of LG fans and exhaust pipes, generators and plumbing resonate with the technological complexity of city life itself.
>
> Every surface is **strictly utilitarian** and yet conveys a sort of urban aesthetic. The stepladder, diagonally chained to the pipe, draws the eye, and bright orange tubs propped against the patchwork of the stone wall almost create an urban still life.

Perhaps Walls is flaneur in a true sense. One must embellish as many of the details as possible from their personal history, in which case fragrances can be extremely helpful as we have a strong olfactory sense. To understand these experiences is not enough, but one must draw upon from memory and capture the sense of ones' personal identity from it. Detail the structure of the space, how does it feel to inhabit it? How does the memory smell or taste like? Do you smell the bacon and eggs baked at the nearby Greggs while flaneuring down towards Kelvingrove (that is a topic for another post)? It is about reflecting upon the relationship between space and identity. 

When it comes to residential architecture, these Victorian styles could be seen as a gradual evolution from the largely imposing, elaborate Gothic design,  appealing to the romantic Victorian idea that fashion, architecture and furnishings should be beautiful rather than practical. These include Gothic revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Queen Anne, stick style, Romanesque style and shingle style.

A very interesting thing to notice is how the typical Victorian architecture forms a link between the post industrial revolution era and the early moden era. Early 19th century saw the rise of industrialism and changes in the social order, as it is reflected very well in popular culture which does a fantastic job (1000x better than historians) at diagramming the relationship of the characters inhabiting the space and their gradually evolving social identities, albeit those pieces of literature conveys the associations between space and identity uniquely. 

The link [here](https://www.dunnedwards.com/colors/specs/posts/victorian-architecture-past-and-present) provides a good idea for those who are interested in the specifics of the residential designs. For us however, the main subject of interest are the unique experiences induced by Glaswegian architecture.

## A psychological base for Victorian architectural Habits

An alley down the streets of some Victorian building in Buchanan street

Victorian fiction authors (yes, the likes of Sir Aurthur Conan Doyle) believed that people are a product of their architectural spaces and styles. Perhaps it is the transformation of these places into becoming more of a social phenomenon, could be the reason why someone would feel a sense of profoundness while flaneuring these alleys. If incase one would like to know my perspective, then go on and read Charles Dickens, ME Braddon, John Ruskin, Gaston Bachelard, and Charles Eastlake to name a few.

From my experiences flaneuring on the streets of Glasgow, there must be some dialectical relation between architecture and memory. Not that through some sensory force they make us recall some obscure past event, rather they make us feel a subtle sense of their own perception of these establishments, of the way they used to perceive the architecture during their day to day experiences.

For readers who are still very intent on delving into the psychological nuances of architecture (which intersects with fictional history in our case) can have a read [here](https://medium.com/@wagihfyoussef/architecture-space-place-and-memory-b739b3aefe6e), straight from the horses mouth. For those like me who are flaneurers, to summarize, the Victorians were working class people with not much to look out for during their time. People used to work all day, there was no teenage back then (if you ever studied sociology, you'd know what I mean), so children after age 10 were considered adults, while women spent their days managing entire household (recall there were no electrical appliances back then ). Survival was the prime goal, days were spent working, while evenings and nights were spent socializing on the very same streets and alleys which we discussed about with romanticism.

I cannot see anyone busy sipping pena coladas and cancelling people, can you? ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/gallery/2017/jun/02/urchins-alleyways-glimpse-19th-century-glasgow-industry-in-pictures))

If one only looks at the utilitarian nature of the architecture and the hectic working class lives of the people in the Victorian era,
