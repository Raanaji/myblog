Walking towards M8 from the Renfrew street can prove to be a surreal experience. One can only slightly gaze at the colorful graffitis endowing the walls of certain establishments which have gone out of order. It seems an odd combination to have 21st century punk-art on an 1800s architecture, especially when it rains (or snows) during darker hours and the pavement reflects the light of the street lamp. 

When you get towards the M8, you can either take the foot-over bridge and cross onto Woodside Cres, or ... you can turn left and keep walking on the Newton Street towards Premier Inn hotel. What's really funny about this is that once you take that left, you are on a path "where no man can go" because there are no pavements to walk on. What is more strange is that once you take another left towards the station, you get confused whether the station is in the hotel or the hotel is in the station. Funnily even, there are placeholders on the station pointing towards the specific areas of the hotel, making it even more funnier. 

Perplexed may be an understatement to describe my "feelings?" For Charing Cross. What is more perplexing is the feeling when you sit down and try to work at this building called Space. Yes! That building which crosses between Netwon and North street is so surreal, imagine sitting down to work and you can see the two roads intersection, at the same time you can see further down cars plying on the M8. 

What really however is enjoyable is to flaneur down towards the Mitchell Library on a Saturday evening, especially when you are not looking at Google maps all the time. One must read the area, like what really strikes me even till date is to cross the Bath Street towards the criss-cross section of Space office building, the road intersection, and the M8 going right below everyone. Somehow these demarcations direct us around the urbanscape. Pretty interestingly I have found myself to avoid certain areas to walk (not just in Charing Cross but elsewhere in other parts of the City, as well as in any City I have ever walked in), indicating towards some sort of a power play dictating our walking patterns.

## Disruptions fostering curiosity

Flaneuring disrupts these patterns, in our own way we can rebel and  diffuses these tensions with the help of light drifting pavilions which act as markers of informal pathways. By taking unbeaten paths, flaneurs gently regain their rights to the city in the form of a gentle rebellion. It is about capturing the distinctive elements of the space rather than more reputable identifiers of the city.

Certain elements which really attract me towards Glasgow are 

- Light and Shadow (walking alleys of downtown Glasgow on a cold winter night)
- Remnants (victorian architecture being hybridized with 20-21st century technology such as heaters, digital placeholders, small trucks parked in an alley full of  materials of some sort)
- Texture (most Glaswegian walls have the same stone slab with either brick reddish or light grayish texture)
- The essence of pavements (mix it with the prospect of wet pavements due to snow or rains, with an assortment of lights reflecting from the surface, changes the psychogeography of the place)
- Day to day life (people walking down the road with Tesco bags, or a young guy with his backpack perhaps a student or some software dev, trying to get to the station, or a bunch of guys just trying to have good time during their pub crawl)

Interesting one could observe these clusters and see if they can be relatable to those in their own city. Do not do the obvious (there is a Taco bell in Glasgow, so it is in Barcelona and Mumbai), find uniqueness and flavor. Perhaps Glasgow could be similar to Oslo or Espoo, maybe London is more similar to Stuttgart than Edinburgh.

## Can I ask you something different?

How different does the grass growing from an algae on a pavement seem to you when it grows in London to that in Turin or Glasgow for that matter? Is there some difference? What about crossing lights, how are they different in your city? Do you thing these subtle difference affect your strolling pattern?

## The Abstraction

Have a look at this image from Charing Cross station

There are multiple elements of abstraction present here, from the tiles on the wall, the advertisement poster, the pavement, as well as the ceiling of the station entrance. 

How about this one?

Pretty surreal isn't it? The lamps add an extra layer of surrealism atop of the station walls and the M8 bridge cross the station. 

## My Flaneuring Pattern

![drifting](/assets/aesthetics/drifting.png)

The path taken is usually from Renfrew Street to Stewart House, which is a fairly straight path. Most of my wanderings are around the said area on either side of the M8. The areas under the reachable circle (where I have flaneured previously) are Kelvingrove, University of Glasgow, Anderston, Glasgow School of Arts, Bath Street. The three places I loved having a meal at (while on the way) were Gregs (yes, the same old bacon and eggs with coffe), New Golden Bell, and Mother India's Cafe. 

Occasionally it is recommended to take a ride from Charing Cross to Queen Street, just to enjoy the bizarre lush of profound aesthetic overdose while looking at the majestic architectural wonders surrounding the city centre. The effect is multiplied by several factors during the winter period.
