We will be using the Inception movie [screenplay](https://www.nolanfans.com/library/pdf/inception-screenplay.pdf) to single out different statements made by different characters and use them to back our conclusion of the movie ending.

### Creation and Perception

> If you’re going to perform inception, you need imagination. You need the simplest version of the idea―the one that will grow naturally in the subject’s mind. Subtle art.” – Eames 

The above quote gives a very good idea into the concept of inception. The subject (whose subconscious has to be invaded) must feel as if the dream has been constructed by the subject's own mind, when in reality the subject only perceives the dream while the construction is done by the **architect** . An architect is the one who designs and structures the layout of the dream, just like in a real world. Though the planning takes place by designing the layout in the real world using models to ideate on the matter more effectively, the information is absorbed by the architect as the models improve and eventually reach their final phase. This is when the architect feels that the models have blossomed fully and he is now capable of **fooling** the subject's subconscious into believing that the subject's own subconscious is the one creating the dream and perceiving it.

> It **creates and perceives a world simultaneously**. So well that you don't feel your brain doing the creating. That's why we can short- circuit the process... - Cobb

> How? - Ariadne

> By taking over the creating part. - Cobb

> This is where you come in. You build the world of the dream. We take the subject into that dream, and let him fill it with his subconscious. - Cobb

The mechanism of simultaneous construction and perception of the constructed world is underlined by Cobb in the very beginning of the movie. Now that we have sufficiently laid out the basics of creation and perception to our reader, we shall now move forward with understanding the concept of **limbo**. Before we do so, we will briefly look at what happens (as per the initial plot of the movie) when an extractor is killed in a dream.



### Death

> That depends on what you're threatening. Killing him would just wake him up... but pain? Pain is in the mind... - Mal

While in the initial mission to extract details from Saito's mind (while on the Shinkansen to Kyoto), it is shown that Arthur wakes up in level 1 (the safe house) after being shot by Cobb in level 2 (the mansion), while the trio wakes up in reality after being killed by the mob in level 1. All of this happens as a part of the set mechanism used by these extractors. This means the maximum level to which they can go down to is level 2 (a dream within a dream). Thus the consequence of death in the dream during an extraction process is that the person wakes up, either to a previous level, or in reality (in case killed in level 1). 

However, the extraction procedure of Fischer Jr. involves three levels (New York, the Hotel, and the Snow Fortress), and thus the sedative required (and used) has to be immensely powerful enough to not knock the subject out of all levels at once, and let the mind go deeper into the dreaming state. This is clear from the conversation which takes place between Cobb and Yusuf in Mombassa.

> A dream within a dream? Two levels? - Yusuf
>
> Three. - Cobb
>
> Not possible. That many dreams within dreams would be too unstable. - Yusuf
>
> I've done it before. You just have to add a sedative. - Cobb
>
> A powerful sedative. How many team members? - Yusuf

What Cobb meant when he said "I've done it before" is his previous experimentation with Mal. The world he created with Mal (and which is shown as raw and crumbling subconscious part in the Limbo).

### Precursor Limbo

In the New York car chase scene, where Fischer's subconscious attacks the team with automatic gun fire, Saito is hit. After taking shelter in a factory, the team reassess the situation and Cobb realizes that Fischer's subconscious has been trained by an extractor to defend itself from people like Cobb. Realizing the futility, Eams takes aim at Saito to shoot him so that he can wake up from the dream.

> What do you mean, it won't wake him? When you die in a dream you wake up. - Eames
>
> Not from this. We're too heavily sedated to wake up that way. - Yusuf
>
> If he... or any one of us dies...that person doesn't wake up. Their mind drops into limbo. - Cobb

The next part by Arthur, and this is critical to our argument, describes what a limbo truly is.

### The Limbo

> Unconstructed dream space. Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing there but what was built by anyone on the team who's been trapped there before. - Arthur

Let us break down Arthur's statements into simple bread crumbs for us to dissect and digest what it means. 

> Unconstructed dream space 

Simply put a dream space (the dream) which is unconstructed, meaning there is no thought or planning given to constructing the space. If you recall, at the beginning of this discussion we pointed out that a typical dream works on principle of creation and perception, and for an extraction the principle works in a similar manner, expect the creation is done by the **architect** who plans, models, designs, and executes the extraction procedure.

In a limbo however, the dream space has no proper construction as it lacks thought and direction as neither the architect, nor the subject has any idea whatsoever of what is going on.

> Raw, infinite subconscious. Nothing here but **what was built by anyone on the team who's been trapped there before**

**This is the most important line which solidifies our argument!**

Arthur explicitly says that limbo exists only of something which **was** built by someone who **has been here before**. We know that Cobb is the only one in the team who has been to level 3 with Mal. Also, after Mal's demise Cobb has never tried to **CONSTRUCT** anything new. 

> Thus, limbo in the movie consists purely of crumbling architecture created by Cobb during his experimentation with Mal. As a result, it is impossible to experience anything NEW as that would go against the definition of limbo, as described by Arthur.

## The Argument

Using the aforementioned information, we lay down the following facts from the movie in a simple bullet format.

1. Dreams are a continuous process of creation and perception
2. Extraction involves an architect creating the dream and making the subject of extraction feel like it is the subject's dream.
3. A typical extraction using standard sedative consists of 2 level, a.k.a. a dream within a dream.
4. Assuming the use of standard sedatives and a 2 level extraction procedure, death in level 2 results in waking up in level 1, and the same for level 1 means waking up in the real world.
5. For a 3 level extraction, a powerful sedative is required to be formulated. 
6. Death in a 3 level extraction procedure results in going into a limbo.
7. Limbo is raw space which consists of old, crumbling designs constructed by someone who has been to level 3 (in our case Cobb).



## The conclusion

In the final scene after Cobb wakes up, he sees Saito making the call, passing the US immigration and his short conversation with the officer, the gazing at different team members and Fischer Jr. at the baggage area, and finally meeting his father in-law. These are all **NEW** experiences and hence would need for the architect to plan, mode, construct, in short the architect will have to ideate all of this before he can create this thing as a dream. 

However, this goes against the tenets of limbo as explained in the above sections, and thus we can safely conclude the following.

**Cobb successfully convinced Saito that he is in a limbo, they both woke up, Saito makes the call, Cobb got past the immigration without trouble, he met his father in-law and his children, happy ending!**
