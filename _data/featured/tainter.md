> Economy is not the production - keep this in mind!

Before I go on to explain the importance of quantitative perspective in understanding the collapse of civilizations, I would recommend the reader to have a look at the 49 minute video interaction with Joseph Tainter, who is the author of the revolutionary book "The Collapse of Complex Societies". [Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/JsT9V3WQiNA)

Reading the book one can get the idea that the whole concept of collapse is based on two simple principles

- Social Complexity
- Diminishing Returns

As per wikipedia;

> Social complexity can be recognized by numerous differentiated and specialised social and economic roles and many mechanisms through which they are coordinated, and by reliance on symbolic and abstract communication, and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production. Such complexity requires a substantial "energy" subsidy (meaning the consumption of resources, or other forms of wealth).

The above statement can easily be related to the post-industrial world (in the western sphere) where most of the heavy manufacturing jobs have been shored away to India and China. However, there are more high skilled jobs such as software programming, cyber security, content writing, movie production, financial analysts, etc. which do not require any physical heavy lifting, but are heavily dependent on the smooth flow of produces from the east (especially from China, we can clearly see this in case of the electric vehicle production scenario).

> When a society confronts a "problem," such as a shortage of energy, or difficulty in gaining access to it, it tends to create new layers of [bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy), [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure), or social class to address the challenge. Tainter, who first identifies seventeen examples of rapid collapse of societies, applies his model to three case studies: The [Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire), the [Maya civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization), and the [Chaco culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_Puebloans).

The above statement resonates very well with the current form of governance world wide, especially in the past two decades (since the Patriot Act was passed by the U.S. congress). Prism surveillance program which was ran by the NSA is a brilliant analogy to Tainter's statement. If one has to understand this better, have a look at the below scene from the movie (my favorite) "The Bourne Ultimatum " [Video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/DUd5RPVDjPY)

This was back in 2006 (when the movie was being shot), it does not take a genius to imagine the sophistication to which surveillance technologies have reached now. Another clip I would have shared would be from the 2005 movie "V for Vendetta" starring Huge Weaving, however this is not a movie review article and ...

Coming back to the point, the second critical factor which Tainter believes offers explanation for the collapse is diminishing returns (which is also a very important economic term). Wikipedia defines diminishing returns as follows;

> The law of diminishing returns (also known as the law of diminishing marginal productivity) states that in productive processes, increasing a factor of production by one unit, while holding all other production factors constant, will at some point return a lower unit of output per incremental unit of input

Which in simple words means that you get less of what you put in, and that less is not enough to push things forward. Another interesting aspect wikipedia defines about diminishing returns is;

> The law of diminishing returns does not cause a decrease in overall production capabilities, rather it defines a point on a production curve whereby producing an additional unit of output will result in a loss and is known as negative returns. Under diminishing returns, output remains positive, however [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity) and [efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency) decrease.

which means that the output does not decrease but the productivity and efficiency does. This goes very well with the western world where the populace's productivity is on decline and yet there is no decline in production. Tainter claims that;

> innovation that increases productivity is – in the long run – the only way out of the dilemma of declining marginal returns on added investments in complexity.

Tainter has described the old school American startup culture, wherein rather than letting the entire country take risk, the risk is taken by individuals (entrepreneurs) by investing their time and money in the venture. Thus, ensuring that only the best survives in the market and millions of consumers get innovation at the cost of a few failed startups. The examples are plenty, worth mentioning are Apple, Google, Akamai, Heroku, PayPal, etc.

### The Mathematical Model

For a more objective look at the subject at hand, we will refer to the paper "[Disaster Dynamics: Understanding the Role of Quantity in Organizational Collapse](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Disaster-Dynamics%3A-Understanding-the-Role-of-in-Rudolph-Repenning/31de9f72f0516cfd7ae7c7f30f1320a17f3ffbc5)". This paper is a must read and perhaps is one of the few important papers of early 21st century, which has gone completely ignored (like most other important things).

The best example they give in their study is of a small subsystem of the KLM airlines crew.

> Invoking George Mandler’s interruption theory of stress, Weick (1993a: 180) suggested that each of these interruptions increased the level of **autonomic arousal** in the KLM crew, absorbing information processing capacity, **decreasing cognitive efficiency**, and **reducing the number of cues they were able to notice and process**. As the situation progressed and the number of interruptions accumulated, the c**rew ’s ability to manage the increasingly complex system they were facing declined**. The KLM crew **communicated less and less** clearly and developed a narrow and incomplete view of their situation, until, in direct violation of standard procedure, the KLM captain cleared himself for take-off. Then, to outrun a cloud rolling up the runway toward him, he began accelerating for take-off. Unfortunately, the approaching cloud concealed the Pan Am aircraft, which had missed its parking turn-off due to the low visibility. The resulting collision killed all of the 583 people on both planes, one of the worst accidents in aviation history.

Clearly the incident was a mix of lack of interaction within the crew (recall the cockpit back then used to have captain, first officer, and a flight engineer), and build up of errors resulting from cognitive biases. In simple words, if the environment in which you are starts getting warm (for instance) then rather than adjusting to the environment you must either get the temperature in check, or flee from that location. Let us take a look at another example which contains a lot of undertones similar to the ones found generally around the stock market crash periods. This example is that of USS Vincennes when it had accidentally shot down Iran Air flight 655. The reason, too much noise during battle drills.

> **High noise levels and bursts of information** about the ongoing gunboat battles interrupted efforts to address the incoming aircraft. A jammed forward gun interrupted the ongoing battle maneuvers. Headphone communications reached crew members over several channels, **with left and right ears sometimes receiving different messages**, and the messages were periodically interrupted when everyone changed communication channels. This barrage of small interruptions **raised stress levels and degraded** the crew ’s cognitive and emotional capabilities.

These interruption can be modeled as an equation

**Interruptions pending(t) = ∫ [Interruption arrival rate(s) – Net interruption resolution rate (s)]ds + Interruptions pending(t0)**

Think of these interruptions as micro-fractures which accumulate over the years as nobody pays attention towards them. They flow, accumulate, interrupt, then burst! The reason why these interruptions accumulate is given as;

> 1. Resolving interruptions requires conscious cognitive effort; 
> 2. the ability to attend to and execute tasks is finite; and therefore 
> 3. the rate at which interruptions arrive may exceed the rate at
>    which they are resolved.

Resolution of interruptions is essential for survival, they cannot go ignored. This requires increased cognitive effort, which points towards increased complexity.

 ![floww](/assets/tainter/floww.png)

The above model brilliantly and visually represents the core of our argument. These interruptions are known as **non-novel** interruptions. How do we model stress on the system which is a result of these increased interruptions?

> Stress: It is modeled as arising from a mismatch between the desired resolution rate and the rate at which interruptions are normally resolved.

So one is unable to resolve the bridge between the conflict and resolution, just like piling up of office work. The piled up work puts immense pressure on the employee, which demands over-time work, yet the pile up does not stop (in fact it only grows), and one day the employee either snaps or just quits. Unfortunately, for societies, it means total chaos and eventual collapse.

## Yerkes–Dodson law

To understand this vague intertwined relation between stress-interruption-accumulation, we refer to Yerkes-Dodson law, defined by wikipedia as follows

> The law dictates that performance increases with physiological or mental arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance decreases.

![dodson](/assets/tainter/dodson.png)

Looking at the definition and the above chart, this is something which we all can relate with. We can work all we want when we are charged up, but after a while the performance and the productivity always goes for a toss.

However, more stress does not merely imply that productivity decreases, rather there is an amplification in the changes in stress, which makes it rather impossible for systems to engage in any sort of countering mechanisms. Nassim Taleb has repeatedly emphasized on the importance of small stressors, which in essence are the reason why our natural systems (bodily or environmental) are anti fragile. However, these minuscule stressors turn into interruptions and eventually disasters if left unchecked. 

**Example Stressor**: Deadlifting without any prior training will result in certain back injury. Deadlifting a certain weight with prior training will result in back muscle improvement. This is training.

**Example Interruption**: Being forced to lift a heavy object because the situation demands. Without prior training it will be impossible to do it. If done without training, it would be dangerous. If not done and delayed, and if in case it is a life-death situation, it would turn the odds against the subject.

![tip](/assets/tainter/tip.png)

Interestingly, the figure above describing the tipping point is the same as that of a [maximum entropy distribution](https://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/maximum-entropy-distributions/) 

![binary_entropy](/assets/tainter/binary_entropy.png)

I will create a separate post dedicated to discussing the various nuances of maximum entropy distribution, from a statistical practitioner's point of view. Just to clear the confusion, we are talking about **information entropy** and not the thermodynamic entropy of physics, both are distinct matters. In information entropy, the entropy is lower if there is more certainty regarding the probabilistic outcome, else the entropy increases, reaching a tipping point. 

> The more biased towards a certain the less entropy (information/surprise) we get (on average).

This could also be funnily termed as a life lesson, wherein people should be open to all possibilities to maximize the chance of the best thing happening in their lives.

Coming back to the subject at hand, it is important to note that the two graphs are not only identical in shape, but also their logic. For instance, lesser stress equates with lower interruption resolution rate, meaning there is not much "happening around in the society". However, extreme stress results in the same outcome, that is lowered productivity and efficiency. 

So we can lay down the entire problem in simple points;

1. Information overload 
2. Unable to resolve interruptions

This inability to resolve comes from the fact that the civilization loses its "roots" or shall we say the knowledge and the knowhow (principles) which brought prosperity and stability. Thus, when faced with overload of information (which as we know is natural and is a requirement for progress - as maximum entropy states) the societies snap and collapse. 

> if the stress level rises enough to push the system into the downward-sloping portion of the curve, **the added  stress  causes  a  decline  in  the  resolution  rate**, that  is  the  dynamics  of  stress  and performance do not  perform a  regulatory function  (as  occur into  the upward portion of the curve) but **rather amplify changes in stress** in a reinforcing feedback process

Thus, more stress reduces resolution rate and amplifies the changes in stress, making it impossible to anticipate and counteract its effects. A more simpler way to see it, as we discussed at the very beginning of this post (using the scene from the movie Bourne Ultimatum as an example); as the situation becomes dire (information overload - inability to resolve), societal controls are centralized. People cease to use their own cognitive abilities and let specific bodies make decisions for them (government taxation, bureaucracy, etc). This in turn amplifies the stress, reduced innovation at smaller levels (more regulations), and makes it impossible for the society to climb back to stability. 

We have borrowed the diagrams and equation from the paper [A Simple System Dynamic Model for the Collapse of Complex Societies](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-simple-system-dynamic-model-for-the-collapse-of-Bueno/1f13c22008f5a47cfcef237d44e70b579b7eba26). 

![flow](assets/tainter/flow.png)

The above diagram lays out a basic structure for the collapse of ancient societies. 

Let's take the following relationship and turn them into equations, where d represents the marginal change in the variable as per differentiation laws.

1. **dPopulation / dt = births - deaths** 

2. **Births = Population x % females x fecundity rate**

3. **Deaths = Population x mortality rate**

![11-Figure3-1](/assets/tainter/11-Figure3-1.png)

For each variable mentioned, we can do a standard econometric regression analysis, keeping the variable as dependent variable. For instance the mortality rate (MR) can be modeled as 

MR = α + βF + γM + e

where α is the constant, F is the food per capita, M being medical factor, e is the error term, β and γ are  coefficients. This is just a simple model, but can be transformed easily into a proper econometric analysis using python or R markdown notebooks, or Mathematica as tools.

This will form an interesting aspect to investigate and will be kept of a later post.
