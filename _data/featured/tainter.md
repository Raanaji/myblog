> Economy is not the production - keep this in mind!

Before I go on to explain the importance of quantitative perspective in understanding the collapse of civilizations, I would recommend the reader to have a look at the 49 minute video interaction with Joseph Tainter, who is the author of the revolutionary book "The Collapse of Complex Societies".

Reading the book one can get the idea that the whole concept of collapse is based on two simple principles

- Social Complexity
- Diminishing Returns

As per wikipedia;

> Social complexity can be recognized by numerous differentiated and specialised social and economic roles and many mechanisms through which they are coordinated, and by reliance on symbolic and abstract communication, and the existence of a class of information producers and analysts who are not involved in primary resource production. Such complexity requires a substantial "energy" subsidy (meaning the consumption of resources, or other forms of wealth).

The above statement can easily be related to the post-industrial world (in the western sphere) where most of the heavy manufacturing jobs have been shored away to India and China. However, there are more high skilled jobs such as software programming, cyber security, content writing, movie production, financial analysts, etc. which do not require any physical heavy lifting, but are heavily dependent on the smooth flow of produces from the east (especially from China, we can clearly see this in case of the electric vehicle production scenario).

> When a society confronts a "problem," such as a shortage of energy, or difficulty in gaining access to it, it tends to create new layers of [bureaucracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy), [infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure), or social class to address the challenge. Tainter, who first identifies seventeen examples of rapid collapse of societies, applies his model to three case studies: The [Western Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire), the [Maya civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization), and the [Chaco culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancestral_Puebloans).

The above statement resonates very well with the current form of governance world wide, especially in the past two decades (since the Patriot Act was passed by the U.S. congress). Prism surveillance program which was ran by the NSA is a brilliant analogy to Tainter's statement. If one has to understand this better, have a look at the below scene from the movie (my favorite) "The Bourne Ultimatum "

This was back in 2006 (when the movie was being shot), it does not take a genius to imagine the sophistication to which surveillance technologies have reached now. Another clip I would have shared would be from the 2005 movie "V for Vendetta" starring Huge Weaving, however this is not a movie review article and ...

Coming back to the point, the second critical factor which Tainter believes offers explanation for the collapse is diminishing returns (which is also a very important economic term). Wikipedia defines diminishing returns as follows;

> The law of diminishing returns (also known as the law of diminishing marginal productivity) states that in productive processes, increasing a factor of production by one unit, while holding all other production factors constant, will at some point return a lower unit of output per incremental unit of input

Which in simple words means that you get less of what you put in, and that less is not enough to push things forward. Another interesting aspect wikipedia defines about diminishing returns is;

> The law of diminishing returns does not cause a decrease in overall production capabilities, rather it defines a point on a production curve whereby producing an additional unit of output will result in a loss and is known as negative returns. Under diminishing returns, output remains positive, however [productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity) and [efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficiency) decrease.

which means that the output does not decrease but the productivity and efficiency does. This goes very well with the western world where the populace's productivity is on decline and yet there is no decline in production. Tainter claims that;

> innovation that increases productivity is – in the long run – the only way out of the dilemma of declining marginal returns on added investments in complexity.

Tainter has described the old school American startup culture, wherein rather than letting the entire country take risk, the risk is taken by individuals (entrepreneurs) by investing their time and money in the venture. Thus, ensuring that only the best survives in the market and millions of consumers get innovation at the cost of a few failed startups. The examples are plenty, worth mentioning are Apple, Google, Akamai, Heroku, PayPal, etc.

### The Mathematical Model

For a more objective look at the subject at hand, we will refer to the paper "[Disaster Dynamics: Understanding the Role of Quantity in Organizational Collapse](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Disaster-Dynamics%3A-Understanding-the-Role-of-in-Rudolph-Repenning/31de9f72f0516cfd7ae7c7f30f1320a17f3ffbc5)". This paper is a must read and perhaps is one of the few important papers of early 21st century, which has gone completely ignored (like most other important things).

The best example they give in their study is of a small subsystem of the KLM airlines crew.

> Invoking George Mandler’s interruption theory of stress, Weick (1993a: 180) suggested that each of these interruptions increased the level of **autonomic arousal** in the KLM crew, absorbing information processing capacity, **decreasing cognitive efficiency**, and **reducing the number of cues they were able to notice and process**. As the situation progressed and the number of interruptions accumulated, the c**rew ’s ability to manage the increasingly complex system they were facing declined**. The KLM crew **communicated less and less** clearly and developed a narrow and incomplete view of their situation, until, in direct violation of standard procedure, the KLM captain cleared himself for take-off. Then, to outrun a cloud rolling up the runway toward him, he began accelerating for take-off. Unfortunately, the approaching cloud concealed the Pan Am aircraft, which had missed its parking turn-off due to the low visibility. The resulting collision killed all of the 583 people on both planes, one of the worst accidents in aviation history.

Clearly the incident was a mix of lack of interaction within the crew (recall the cockpit back then used to have captain, first officer, and a flight engineer), and build up of errors resulting from cognitive biases. In simple words, if the environment in which you are starts getting warm (for instance) then rather than adjusting to the environment you must either get the temperature in check, or flee from that location. Let us take a look at another example which contains a lot of undertones similar to the ones found generally around the stock market crash periods. This example is that of USS Vincennes when it had accidentally shot down Iran Air flight 655. The reason, too much noise during battle drills.

> **High noise levels and bursts of information** about the ongoing gunboat battles interrupted efforts to address the incoming aircraft. A jammed forward gun interrupted the ongoing battle maneuvers. Headphone communications reached crew members over several channels, **with left and right ears sometimes receiving different messages**, and the messages were periodically interrupted when everyone changed communication channels. This barrage of small interruptions **raised stress levels and degraded** the crew ’s cognitive and emotional capabilities.

These interruption can be modeled as an equation

**Interruptions pending(t) = ∫ [Interruption arrival rate(s) – Net interruption resolution rate (s)]ds + Interruptions pending(t0)**

Think of these interruptions as micro-fractures which accumulate over the years as nobody pays attention towards them.





We borrow the following diagram from the paper [A Simple System Dynamic Model for the Collapse of Complex Societies](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-simple-system-dynamic-model-for-the-collapse-of-Bueno/1f13c22008f5a47cfcef237d44e70b579b7eba26).

Let's take the following relationship and turn them into equations, where d represents the marginal change in the variable as per differentiation laws.

1. **dPopulation / dt = births - deaths** 

2. **Births = Population x % females x fecundity rate**

3. **Deaths = Population x mortality rate**
