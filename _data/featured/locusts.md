### Cancel Culture - Modern Culture

Are humans a kind of locust? Look at concepts like the BTS Army, look at average instagram posts? What makes you think the people commenting them have any conscious spec of sense and/or are any different from a zombie?

 Humans are normally in “grasshopper” mode, but then, in certain circumstances, they enter locust mode. Look at lynch mobs, the slavering ranters at political rallies, the unloosed crowd, the Mass Man, the prevalence of groupthink, and so on.

In the Exorcist II: The Heretic, a disturbing story is told about locusts. A character says, 

> “The key factor is the brushing of the wings. When it is dry, the grasshoppers go their own way, happy individuals. When a heavy rain hatches them in large numbers, they crowd together. Their wings brush against each other. The agitation transforms them. … Most importantly, the brushing of the wings changes their personality. They become a destructive, voracious, marauding swarm, with a single mind. A locust mind, if you will. The evil swarm sweeps over the earth, possessing all that it touches. Evil breeding evil by contact. … There’s no hope once the wings have brushed you.”

The speaker is trying to breed a female that resists the brushing of the wings, hence does not become evil; it doesn’t get contaminated, infected. The speaker refers to it as “the Good Locust.” He says, “Her children will be our agents in the swarm. Breaking the chain reaction. Remaining forever happy-go-lucky grasshoppers. Let us pray it succeeds.

In human terms, the Good Locust would be a human that doesn’t get swept up in social media hysteria, and doesn’t participate in and add to viral outbreaks. Such humans don’t fall for the hype and celebrity culture. They aren’t desperate to get likes, attention and approval. They aren’t needy.

Locusts are extraordinary creatures. Research indicates that their primary motivation for gathering in vast swarms that devour everything in their path (like a social media storm that destroys whatever gets in its way) is that they are terrified of being eaten by each other!

A locust swarm can contain billions of insects. It can eat tens of thousands of tons of vegetation in a single day. It is one of the most destructive powers in nature.

Although locusts are usually herbivores, scientists have observed them eating each other. This occurs when normal food supplies start to run short, when the locusts cannot get hold of enough food, when they start to starve and become desperate. Then they turn into cannibals. When some locusts begin to eat other locusts, all of the locusts panic.

Each locust wants the same things: protein, salt, nutrients, and so on. If the environment doesn’t provide what they need then their fellow locusts can provide it, if they eat them!

Once cannibalism breaks out amongst starving locusts, all locusts start moving, to try to get away from the hungry cannibals chasing them from behind. Increasing numbers of locusts band together, almost without limit. If you don’t move, you get eaten. You have to move with the crowd, or the crowd devours you. (Exactly the same metaphorical pattern is played out on social media every day. Humans are keyboard locusts.)

So, the equation is simple. Go with the flow of the crowd, or become the crowd’s victim. Never try to stand out against the crowd. The crowd always wins. Kafka said, “In man’s struggle against the world, bet on the world.” Equally, in the individual’s struggle against the crowd, bet on the crowd.

Locusts are normally solitary creatures, but, in the right circumstances, they form into an unstoppable swarm. Most human “individualists” likewise become baying members of the mob when the circumstances are right.

Locusts form a voracious whirlwind darkening the sky. They were one of the Biblical plagues. They are a sight to be seen.

One intriguing speculation about locust behavior says that all the locusts start to synchronize their wing beats at the same frequency, and this is how they identify each other as fellow locusts – not to be eaten. Any locust that doesn’t vibrate at the same frequency, that doesn’t synchronize, is regarded as an alien, as a non-locust, hence gets eaten.

Amongst humans, the process is very similar. Anyone who lacks a rapport with the herd, the flock, who stands out against the crowd, who doesn’t “synchronize their wing-beat” to fit in with everyone else, is targeted as an enemy and destroyed.

Humans may talk of individuals, but practically all humans are pseudo-individuals, much more likely to engage in swarm behavior and reflect a swarm mind than they would ever care to admit.

Humans say, “Don’t swim against the tide.” That’s what you’re doing if you refuse to resonate with the mass and instead try to carve out your own path.”

“The “individual” rarely succeeds. The human swarm – the mob – is vastly more powerful. Individuals become powerful only when they can control the swarms, as kings, prophets, dictators, high priests, presidents, and so on, do. In other words, they are not actually individuals at all but swarm leaders, apex swarm actors. They are the ones that set the wing-beat, to which all the others then synchronize.

Humans are increasingly ruled by in-group and out-group dynamics. The in-group all resonate at the same frequency – they all beat their wings at the same rate and thus synchronize their thoughts and beliefs. Look at political rallies. All attendants have set up their identical “wing-beat”, attuned to the guy on the stage telling them what to think.

What is the out-group? It’s everyone not resonating at the “right” frequency. They are the enemy. The out-group may consist of individuals that haven’t synchronized with the in-group. Or it may comprise a rival group with its own wing-beat, to which all of its own members are synchronized. Thus we get, for example, the culture war between conservatives and liberals.

“What is “deplatforming”? Wikipedia says, “Deplatforming, also known as no-platforming, is a form of political activism or prior restraint by an individual, group, or organization with the goal of shutting down controversial speakers or speech, or denying them access to a venue in which to express their opinion.”

“Why are people denied a platform to speak? It’s because they are beating their wings at a different frequency, and the sight and sound of that sends people wild. They cannot bear a contrarian wing-beat. The asynchronous are the enemy. They must be destroyed, or at least prevented from getting others to synchronize with their opposing wing-beat. Don’t give others the chance to resonate with them.

What are “comfort zones”? These are the places where people hangout only with people metaphorically beating their wings at the same frequency. They are echo chambers, silos, reinforcers. No one is challenged in their comfort zone. They are never exposed to contrary influences.

Many people with a minority wing-beat are terrified of the majority swarm (which will devour them) and seek to carve out a “safe space” where they will be free of predation.

We all unfollow, block, and unfriend anyone that does not dance to our tune, beat to our rhythm, synchronize their wings with ours so that we all fly together rather than apart.

Our whole world is now driven by “swarm mechanics”. Every in-group seeks to get all other groups and individuals to synchronize with their wing beat, and to destroy any that don’t.

Memes and trolling are the primary battering rams to try to bring about wing-beat synchronization.
